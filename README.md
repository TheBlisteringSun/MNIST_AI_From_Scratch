# MNIST_AI_From_Scratch
I made a digit recognition ML algorithm using only NumPy!
I have always wanted to code an AI with minimal assistance, as all the info on ML was too high-level and abstracted to my liking. 
When I started this project in the summer of 2024, I aimed to deepen my understanding of common ML algorithms and the maths behind them. I can definitely say that I did succeed in that.  
  
To any budding AI enthusiasts, I hope this project sparks your passion for ML and that you try tackling this problem too.    
Some resources that helped me tremendously are: (Listed in order of suggested usage)  
\-**Khan Academy's course on Precalculus** (https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) **Optional but helps if the following resources are incomprehensible*  
\-**3Blue1Brown's playlist called The Essence of Calculus** (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
